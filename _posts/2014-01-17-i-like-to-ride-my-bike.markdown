Riding home today in the 38º heat, I was reminded again why I so enjoy
riding my bicycle to work.

It's not the exercise, or being out in the sun (ahahahaha, 38ºC,
remember?), or the fact that I'm using [the most efficient transport
mechanism known][human-power], or even the feeling of riding past a
bus on a cold evening, rolling through the cloud of warmth surrounding
the big diesel engine before escaping back into the chill.

It's the connections that I make with people on my way.

It's the young kid out learning to ride in the park for a few days
in a row, with his dad hanging around peering into his phone.

It's the office worker crossing the road in front of me, hesitating, as she
would for a car, before I wave to her that I can go around.

It's the guy coming the other way on his bike, with time to share a smile.

It's the young hoons that yell at me out of their van as they speed past.

Today's event was trivial. I came to an intersection where I have to
give way, but the car coming across in front of me wasn't so sure
about the intersection – or me, I suspect.

As I slowed down to wait, the driver realised I was going to
wait for him, and – sealed away inside his air-conditioned private
space – pointed *straight at me*. Arm fully extended.

Why? No idea. Had I done something wrong in his eyes? Was he
just acknowledging that I was there? A *thanks-for-stopping*?
Truly no idea.

But for a brief second, I intruded into his world, and he into
mine. *This* is what I truly enjoy about riding. <del>Sometimes</del>
<del>often</del> regularly, someone and I will interact briefly. I
will be made aware of their presence *as a human*, and them of mine.

Sealed away inside my own air-conditioned licence-plate–bearing
private space, I would miss this. The only real way to interact with
other drivers when you're in a car is by horn, or by lights, or by car
positioning. All sorely lacking in expressiveness. And, at the speed
of car travel, it's *blink-and-you-miss-it*.

And pedestrians? Forget about it. Pedestrians and drivers are like
young people and cops. The only time they come into contact, both are
pretty suspicious of the other's motives.

But on my bike, I can wave to that bearded dude – always a bearded
dude – on the recumbent.

I can gesture to the woman waiting for me to pass, that she doesn't
need to wait, because I'm turning right.

I can wonder all evening why some old guy in a car, wearing
sunglasses, pointed straight at me as he turned right.

That's why I like to ride my bike.
